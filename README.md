# What if Bruce from 🙏🏻 *Bruce Almighty* 🙏🏻 knew how to play with data?

*Bruce Almighty* is a fantasy comedy film (Wikipedia) that inspired this little exploratory data analysis (EDA )project. ☺️  
The idea came to me while (re)watching *Bruce Almighty*. 😁  
(I also rewatched *Liar Liar*, *Hot Shots: Part Deux*, *Ace Ventura* etc. 😌... What? 🤨 Comedy is always the best!!! 😁... No? 🫤)  

There’s a scene in *Bruce Almighty* where Bruce organizes all the prayers into a database, and I thought to myself:  
*“What if those prayers were treated as a dataset and explored systematically? 🤔”*  

Since I couldn’t find a suitable dataset online, I asked ChatGPT to create one with just over 100 rows and a few columns (work smarter 😎, not harder 😏).

As someone who loves anime, I decided to make the dataset more fun and personal.
It includes anime references and characters *praying* for particular outcomes. Each row represents a fictional request, complete with urgency levels and a Deserve_Score.

This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to:
- Understand the structure of the dataset
- Identify inconsistencies and clean the data
- Examine distributions and patterns
- Explore relationships between urgency, reference, and deserving score
- Derive meaningful insights from structured fictional data

This is what I would do if I had to make sense of a database full of prayers while God went on a nice (extremely short 😅) vacation.

#### Inspiration
Movie: *Bruce Almighty* (2003) — the scene where Bruce converts prayers into data.
This project is **my personal spin** on that idea, blending creativity with machine learning.

This project blends:
- Creativity (fictional prayer dataset)
- Personal interest (anime references and characters such as Naruto, One Piece, Demon Slayer, Dragon Ball, Attack on Titan, and more)
- Structured analytical thinking (EDA workflow)

The dataset features various anime characters “praying” for different outcomes, combining storytelling elements with structured data exploration.
