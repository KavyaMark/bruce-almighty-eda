# 🙌 Bruce Almighty: An Exploratory Data Analysis Project 🙌

Inspired by the movie *Bruce Almighty*, where Bruce organizes prayers into a database, this project asks:
What if we treated those prayers as structured data and explored them systematically?
This project focuses purely on exploratory data analysis (EDA) applied to a synthetic dataset of fictional prayer requests made by anime characters.

## 📊 Project Overview 📊

- Created a synthetic dataset representing fictional prayer requests

- Performed structured exploratory data analysis (EDA):
  - Inspected dataset structure and dimensions
  - Identified and handled missing values
  - Checked for duplicate records
  - Standardized categorical variables (e.g., urgency levels)
  - Converted numeric columns to appropriate data types
  - Conducted univariate and bivariate analysis
 
 - Exported a cleaned dataset for future use

This project demonstrates structured data cleaning, visualization, and interpretation techniques using Python.

## 🔎 Key Analysis Areas 🔍

- Distribution of anime references and characters
- Relationship between urgency levels and Deserve_Score
- Comparison of Deserve_Score across top characters and anime
- Structural analysis of prayer subject lengths

## ‼️ Limitations ‼️

- The dataset is synthetic and not derived from real-world data
- Some characters appear only once, which may affect average score calculations
- Deserve_Score values are manually assigned for demonstration purposes

## 🎬 Inspiration 🎬

Movie:
- *Bruce Almighty* (2003) — particularly the scene where prayers are converted into structured data.
